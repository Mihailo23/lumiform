# PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE PULLING THE CODE!!!!

So, in two hours, I managed almost nothing right, the only part that kinda works is uploading and downloading JSON files, but this only works well, for pages, so questions and section don't even get written anywhere...

Maybe I should have started with vuex all from the beginning, it would be easier to keep place of the data, but I didn't prepare well I think, and this is why I think what i did is reeeealy shit :)

I think I would manage to finish it with more time, but that is not the problem, the problem, I think, is bad approach, and when I became aware of it, it was too late...

Nevertheless, thank you for the opportunity :)
